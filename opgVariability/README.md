### plot_anom_opg_case_19_v2.m
This MATLAB script pulls the OPG coefficients of a single facet and formulates the terciles of the OPG Concavity (P1) and OPG at the lowest elevation (P2). From the strong negative linear relationship between P1 and P2, these terciles can divide the OPG events into 9 cases, with most events residing within the diagonal. A scatter plot of OPG event coefficients and boxplots of the coefficient values by season are plotted first, then the subsequent composites of OPG events which reside within the diagonal for DJF and JJA. These events plotted from DJF and JJA fall within the categories of strong sublinear increase, sublinear increase, and superlinear increase/sublinear decrease. 

### plot_atmos_hrzntl_vrtcl_cases_19.py
This Python script plots the average atmosphere of a strong sublinear increase and superliner increase/sublinear decrease between DJF and JJA for a single facet. Plots include a horizontal plot of 500 hPa winds, 850 hPa heights and winds, and IVT, and a meridional cross-section plot of meridional moisture transport and transport anomalies.
