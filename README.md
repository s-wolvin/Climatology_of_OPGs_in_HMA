# UofU_HiMAT_2020-22
This repository stores the most useful programs created during my Masters Thesis Research at the University of Utah, funded by NASA's High Mountian Asia Team (HiMAT). <br /> <br />
#### Many of these scripts require the following datasets/open-source code. <br />
* Country Borders from Natural Earth: <br />

* Export High-Resolution and Transparent Figures: <br />

* M_MAP: A Mapping Package for MATLAB: <br />

## nclColormaps
Folder containing NCL Colormaps converted into MATLAB files to be used in MATLAB programs. Link to the NCL colormaps:  <br />

## post-processingWRF
Scripts created to pull varibles from the HiMAT WRF Model output in .nc files and saves it as a .mat file.

## facetingAlgorithm
Scripts created to load the terrain data from a WRF output file and facet the terrain (i.e., turn terrain into areas grouped by similar facing orienation, like mountain faces). The faceting algorithm was formulated by Wayne Gibson, Christopher Daly and George Taylor from Oregon State University, Corvallis, Oregon. It is used by the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM). The algoirthm outlined can be found at https://prism.oregonstate.edu/documents/pubs/1997cac_derivationGrids_daly.pdf
